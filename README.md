# Telemetry Workflows

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository is where I store example work-flows to do different data
cleaning operations (e.g., adding metadata, removing false detections,
creating preliminary abacus plots) for acoustic telemetry data.

To get this repo and the example workflows you can download it in R
using the following code and prompts:

``` r
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/benjaminhlina/telemetry-workflows/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
```
